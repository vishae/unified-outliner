/**
 * Phase 5T-3A ("paragraph non-adjacent move の最小実装"): a pure function
 * that moves a Tree-displayed paragraph to a NON-adjacent position within
 * the same safe sibling group (same parentId/depth), by cutting it out and
 * re-inserting it before/after another paragraph or standalone complex
 * block (callout/blockquote) sibling — in exactly ONE edit, never as a
 * sequence of adjacent swaps. This is Phase 5T-3D's design (see
 * docs/phase5t3_non_adjacent_paragraph_move_design.md) turned into code;
 * see that document for the full design rationale (案A vs 案B vs 案C, the
 * `insertBlockAt` auto-offset-correction finding, the blank-line-insertion
 * requirement) — this file's own doc comments cover only the
 * implementation-level detail that document didn't already fix in place.
 *
 * ---- Reused unchanged ----
 *
 *   - `edit/paragraphTreeMove.ts#resolveAnchorUnit` — the SOURCE side's
 *     existing three-stage (id-candidate / structural / content +
 *     document-wide ambiguity) re-resolution contract, exported from that
 *     module for this reuse. Source is always a paragraph in this phase
 *     (ticket §1: "source は paragraph node"), so this file never needs a
 *     paragraph-specific variant of its own.
 *   - `move/moveBlock.ts#insertBlockAt` — the generic cut-and-reinsert
 *     primitive. Its own internal offset self-correction already answers
 *     the design doc's "does target range shift after source removal need
 *     tail-first processing" question (no) — this file passes it ORIGINAL
 *     (pre-cut) line numbers exactly as its own doc comment requires, and
 *     never relies on its silent "target falls inside source" clamp
 *     branch: overlap is rejected explicitly, below, before this is ever
 *     called.
 *
 * ---- New in this file ----
 *
 *   - `resolveTargetAnchor` — the TARGET side's own three-stage
 *     re-resolution, symmetric to `resolveAnchorUnit` but generalized over
 *     `ComplexBlockKind` (a target may be a paragraph OR a standalone
 *     callout/blockquote — ticket §1), whereas `resolveAnchorUnit` is
 *     paragraph-only. Design doc §5-1's explicit requirement: target gets
 *     the SAME rigor as source (content-byte match + document-wide
 *     ambiguity check), not just `resolveParagraphFromTreeHint`'s weaker
 *     structural-hint-only match (that function is 5T-2's D&D-only
 *     dragover hint resolver and is never reused here).
 *   - `ensureBlankSeparation` — the new, paragraph-specific safety rule
 *     design doc §5-2 requires: parser/complexBlocks.ts#scanParagraphBlocks
 *     defines a paragraph purely as "a run of consecutive lines that are
 *     each individually a `isCandidate` line" (not blank, not a heading,
 *     not a list marker — see that function's own doc comment). Critically,
 *     `isCandidate` does NOT exclude `>`-prefixed (callout/blockquote) or
 *     pipe-table-row-shaped lines either — only blank/heading/list lines
 *     break a paragraph-candidate run. So inserting a moved paragraph
 *     directly adjacent (no blank line) to ANY other non-blank,
 *     non-heading, non-list-marker line — another paragraph, OR a
 *     callout/blockquote's own quote-prefixed line — would let
 *     scanParagraphBlocks' candidate loop sweep both together into ONE
 *     paragraph-candidate range, which then overlaps the neighbor's own
 *     (higher-priority, for callout/blockquote) recognized range and gets
 *     downgraded to "ambiguous" by mergeBlockRangesSafely's overlap policy
 *     — corrupting recognition of the moved paragraph itself, not just
 *     failing to keep it separate. `ensureBlankSeparation` inserts a blank
 *     line on either side of the moved block whenever the adjacent line is
 *     non-blank and not a heading/list-marker line (the only three
 *     boundary types scanParagraphBlocks' own `isCandidate` already
 *     recognizes as breaking a candidate run) — deliberately NOT scoped to
 *     "only when the neighbor happens to be another paragraph", since the
 *     entanglement risk above applies identically to a callout/blockquote
 *     neighbor's own quote-prefixed line.
 *
 * ---- Deliberately out of scope (ticket §2) ----
 *
 * paragraph↔list cross-model move, crossing a section/list-item boundary,
 * parent change, child drop, indent/outdent, paragraph rename/delete/
 * insert, Tree Partial Edit, D&D for this operation, `parseDocument.ts`
 * changes, `ParsedDocument.nodes` changes, and any change to the existing
 * 5T-1/5T-2/5T-2S adjacent-move contracts. This file imports nothing from
 * `move/relocateSection.ts`/`move/relocateListSubtree.ts` and does not
 * touch `parser/parseDocument.ts`.

 *      range — can happen if a caller passes the same block as both,
 *      including via two different SiblingTargetAnchor/ParagraphMoveAnchor
 *      captures of what turns out to be the same live block).

 *      (defense-in-depth — structurally implied by parentId equality, same
 *      "recheck rather than only rely on how it was derived" style
 *      `findComplexSiblingTarget` already uses).

 *      itself rather than leaning on `insertBlockAt`'s own silent
 *      mid-source clamp (design doc §5-2's explicit warning against
 *      relying on that).
 *   6. `insertBlockAt(doc.lines, source.range, insertBeforeLine)` — a
 *      single cut-and-reinsert, ORIGINAL (pre-cut) line numbers, exactly
 *      as that function's own contract requires. `insertBeforeLine` is
 *      `target.range.startLine` for "before", `target.range.endLine + 1`
 *      for "after" — both naturally handle "target is the first/last
 *      sibling in the group" and "target is the very first/last block in
 *      the document/section/list-item" with no extra branching (design doc
 *      §5-2).
 *   7. `ensureBlankSeparation` — the new paragraph-specific merge-safety
 *      post-step (see this file's top doc comment).
 *
 * One call, one final `lines[]` -> exactly the "1操作=1編集=1Undo" contract
 * ticket §4 requires, once a caller feeds this outcome through the SAME
 * single-`replaceRange` `commands/applyLineEditOutcome.ts#applyLineEditOutcome`
 * every other move in this codebase already uses — no new CM6
 * undo-grouping mechanism is introduced or needed here.
