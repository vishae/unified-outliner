/**
 * Phase 5D-0.5 ("Quote Prefix Projection for Partial Edit"): a pure,
 * Obsidian-free text transform that lets the Partial Edit Pane show a
 * callout/blockquote's BODY content without its leading `>` prefix (and,
 * for a callout, without its header line at all), while still round-
 * tripping back to byte-identical raw Markdown on Apply.
 *
 * This module does NOT know about ParsedDocument, ComplexBlockInfo,
 * doc.nodes, or any parser/scanner concept — it operates purely on the
 * raw multi-line text edit/partialEdit.ts's extractSubtreeText already
 * returns for a "supported" callout/blockquote (see that function's own
 * doc comment), plus the caller-supplied `kind`. This keeps the same
 * "each layer is independently testable, no Obsidian dependency creeps
 * downward" discipline every other edit/* module in this plugin already
 * follows. No new parser/writer/Markdown-normalization logic is added —
 * this module only ever slices/rejoins strings that extractSubtreeText/
 * applySubtreeEdit (both unmodified) already treat as ground truth.
 *
 * ---- The core invariant: prefix + content === original line, always ----
 *
 * Every QuotePrefixLineMapping splits ONE raw body line into exactly two
 * substrings — `prefix` (everything from the start of the line through
 * its `>` marker and at most one following space/tab) and `content`
 * (everything after that) — such that `prefix + content` reconstructs the
 * original line byte-for-byte, unconditionally, for ANY input line (the
 * split point can never fail to cover the whole line, since `content` is
 * captured via `.*` with no length restriction — see LINE_PREFIX_RE).
 * This is what makes invertQuotePrefixProjection lossless: it never
 * re-derives or re-normalizes a prefix, it only ever concatenates the
 * ORIGINAL prefix (captured once, at build time) with whatever content
 * the textarea now holds for that line.
 *
 * ---- Two "do not project" cases ----
 *
 * buildQuotePrefixProjection reports exactly two distinct failure
 * reasons, and the two are NOT interchangeable — see this ticket's
 * approved scope for the exact caller-side handling of each:
 *
 *   - "nested": some body line, after stripping exactly ONE level of `>`
 *     prefix, ITSELF still starts with a quote prefix — a plain nested
 *     blockquote (`> > text`, no `[!` marker). This is a real, confirmed
 *     gap in parser/complexBlocks.ts's own nested-quote detection: that
 *     module's hasEmbeddedCalloutMarker/NESTED_CALLOUT_RE only fire for a
 *     nested CALLOUT marker (`> > [!type]`), never for a plain nested
 *     blockquote with no marker at all, so a block containing one can
 *     still reach editability "supported" upstream. This module's own,
 *     independent check is what closes that remaining gap, without
 *     touching parser/complexBlocks.ts at all. The caller (PartialEditView)
 *     must refuse to open the Pane at all for this reason — never fall
 *     back to raw editing — per the approved scope's explicit "raw
 *     fallback を使わない" instruction: nested quote structure is not
 *     something this phase's flat line-mapping model can represent
 *     safely, projected OR raw-in-a-projecting-pane.
 *   - "no-body": a callout whose range is header-only (zero body lines).
 *     The caller must fall back to the EXISTING, unmodified raw Partial
 *     Edit behavior for this reason — this is NOT a rejection; nothing
 *     about the block is unsupported, there is simply nothing to project.
 *     A blockquote can never produce this reason: a "supported"
 *     blockquote's range always has at least one line, and blockquote has
 *     no header line to exclude, so its body-line list is never empty.
 *
 * ---- What counts as an allowed edit ----
 *
 * invertQuotePrefixProjection accepts ONLY a per-line CONTENT change,
 * including emptying a line's content entirely (which still reconstructs
 * as `prefix + ""` — a valid, syntactically bare quoted line like a lone
 * `>`). Any edit that changes the number of lines — adding a line,
 * deleting a line, or splitting/joining lines via an embedded newline —
 * changes `editedDisplayText.split("\n").length` relative to the
 * projection's own `lines.length`, and is refused wholesale with reason
 * "line-count-changed": there is no per-line prefix to attribute to a
 * line that did not exist when the projection was built, and guessing
 * one (e.g. "reuse the previous line's prefix") would silently fabricate
 * Markdown structure that was never in the original note. This mirrors
 * every other refusal policy in this codebase: resolve safely, refuse
 * the operation, never guess.

 * mutated), `newType` (the type combobox's CURRENT value, edited or
 * not), `newMarker` (the fold marker select's CURRENT value, edited or
 * not), and `newTitle` (the title input's CURRENT value, edited or not).
 * `slot.quotePrefix` — leading indentation, `>`, and at most one
 * following space/tab — is NEVER altered by this function; only the
 * type, marker, and title portions change. All three new values are
 * independent inputs combined in a SINGLE reassembly (`quotePrefix +
 * "[!" + newType + "]" + newMarker + effectiveSeparator + newTitle`) —
 * there is no meaningful "order" in which type vs. marker vs. title is
 * applied, since each is just one piece of one concatenation; a caller
 * changing only a subset of the three simply passes the others unchanged
 * (`slot.type` / `slot.marker` / `slot.title`) and gets a byte-identical
 * result for those pieces, exactly like an unedited title already did in
 * 5D-1A and an unedited marker in 5D-1B.
 *
 * Refuses with reason "invalid-type" whenever `newType` is empty, or
 * contains `"]"`, or contains a line break (`\r` and/or `\n` — LF, CRLF,
 * and bare CR are all rejected) — a callout header is exactly one raw
 * Markdown line, and `]` would terminate the `[!type]` span early. Unlike
 * "invalid-marker" below, this branch IS reachable through completely
 * ordinary UI use: the type combobox is free text (see this ticket's own
 * approved UI decision — a `<datalist>` offers suggestions but never
 * constrains the typed value, precisely so custom/alias/unknown callout
 * types the user already has in their vault are never rejected or
 * rewritten), so a user can trivially clear the field or paste a string
 * containing `]`/a line break. The View layer must show a user-facing
 * Notice for this reason — see PartialEditView.ts's applyEdit.
 *
 * Refuses with reason "newline" whenever `newTitle` contains one (5D-1A,
 * unchanged) — same one-line-header rule as above, for the title portion
 * specifically. Refuses with reason "invalid-marker" whenever `newMarker`
 * is anything other than `"" | "+" | "-"` — defense-in-depth only: the
 * TypeScript `CalloutFoldMarker` union already restricts this at compile
 * time, and the View's own fold-marker control is a closed-set `<select>`
 * that can only ever emit one of these three values, so this branch
 * should be unreachable via normal UI (unlike "invalid-type" above). It
 * exists for the same reason buildQuotePrefixProjection's own "should be
 * unreachable in practice" guards exist: never throw, never silently
 * coerce/normalize an unexpected value — fail closed as a safe, ordinary
 * result instead. Any of the three refusals rejects the WHOLE Apply
 * (type edit, marker edit, title edit, AND any body edit together),
 * zero-byte-change, never a partial write — mirroring
 * invertQuotePrefixProjection's own "line-count-changed" refusal
 * contract.
 *
 * `newType` is validated FIRST, before `newMarker` and `newTitle` — an
 * arbitrary but stable order; a caller relying on a specific refusal
 * reason when multiple fields are simultaneously invalid should not
 * assume the others were validated at all, only that no partial header
 * is ever returned on any failure.
 *
 * The separator rules below are 5D-1A's own approved, fixed
 * specification, restated here in terms of `slot.separator` (the
 * whitespace between the marker position and the title) instead of
 * "beforeTitle's trailing whitespace" — the underlying rule is
 * unchanged, and does not depend on whether the type or marker
 * themselves changed:
 *
 *   1. newTitle === "" (title emptied, or was already empty and stays
 *      empty/unedited): `slot.separator` is reused completely unmodified.
 *      Nothing is trimmed, regardless of what newType/newMarker are.
 *   2. `slot.title === ""` (the ORIGINAL title was empty) AND
 *      `slot.separator === ""` (no existing separator at all) and
 *      newTitle is non-empty: exactly one space is synthesized instead
 *      of reusing the (empty) separator — the minimum readability
 *      correction needed for a brand-new title to not glue onto `]` or
 *      the new marker character. This is a pure insertion; it never
 *      touches `quotePrefix` or `type`.
 *   3. Every other case (a non-empty separator already existed, or the
 *      original title was already non-empty): `slot.separator` is reused
 *      verbatim, no space logic — the original separator convention is
 *      deliberately preserved as-is rather than reformatted.
 *
 * An unedited type, unedited title, AND unedited marker (newType ===
 * slot.type, newTitle === slot.title, newMarker === slot.marker) also
 * falls under rule 1 or rule 3 and reconstructs the header byte-identical
 * to the original — the same "unedited Apply changes nothing" guarantee
 * QuotePrefixProjection's body-line split already provides.
