/**
 * Phase 3B: Partial Edit Pane. Extended in Phase 4C to cover list subtrees
 * as a second editable node kind, alongside sections.
 *
 * Pure, Obsidian-free logic for the Partial Edit Pane's two operations:
 * extracting a subtree's raw Markdown text so a separate pane can display
 * it, and later splicing an edited version of that text back into the
 * ORIGINAL note's matching range. Neither function knows anything about
 * panes, textareas, or editors — view/PartialEditView.ts is the only
 * Obsidian-dependent caller.
 *
 * The Partial Edit Pane is deliberately NOT an independent document: the
 * note is always the single source of truth, and this module treats a
 * "partial edit" as nothing more than "replace exactly this subtree's
 * line range with this new text" — never a rewrite of anything outside
 * that range. This mirrors move/relocateSection.ts's "resolve safely,
 * touch nothing else" philosophy, just for content instead of position.
 *
 * Node resolution is primarily `doc.nodes.get(nodeId)` +
 * `isSectionNode`/`isListNode` — the primitives every other tree/* and
 * move/* module already uses — for a section or list id.
 *
 * Phase 5C-2 (2026-08-14, behavior change from the Phase 5C note this
 * replaces): a callout/blockquote id (parser/complexBlocks.ts's
 * ComplexBlockInfo, never inserted into ParsedDocument.nodes) is now ALSO
 * resolvable here — see extractSubtreeText's own doc comment for the exact
 * fresh-scanComplexBlocks fallback and its `editability === "supported"`
 * gate. fenced-code/table/paragraph/thematic-break ComplexBlockInfo ids
 * are deliberately NOT resolvable (out of scope for this ticket) and still
 * resolve to "resolve-failed", unchanged from before.
 *

 * Phase 4C (list subtrees): extractSubtreeText/applySubtreeEdit below are
 * the generalized core — they accept EITHER a section id or a list id,
 * since both ListBlockNode and SectionBlockNode carry the same `.range`
 * every other block-scoped command already treats as "the whole editable
 * unit" (section-subtree for sections; Phase 4A's relocateListSubtree already
 * established the equivalent for list items — item + nested children,
 * exactly what ListBlockNode.range spans, no extra collection needed).
 * extractSectionText/applySectionEdit — Phase 3B's original, section-only
 * functions — are kept UNCHANGED in behavior (same signatures, same
 * reason codes, same tests) by re-expressing extractSectionText as a thin
 * wrapper around extractSubtreeText that rejects anything except a
 * section (see its doc comment below for exactly how). applySectionEdit's
 * own body needed no changes at all, since it only ever calls
 * extractSectionText.
 *
 * Safety: a list subtree with unsafeIndent (mixed tab/space leading
 * whitespace — the same flag move/relocateListSubtree.ts already refuses
 * to relocate) is refused here too, both when the pane first loads it and
 * again when Apply re-extracts the current text for the conflict check —
 * the latter comes for free, since applySubtreeEdit's re-extraction is
 * just another call to extractSubtreeText. Sections have no equivalent
 * concept (heading indentation is never ambiguous), so this check only
 * ever applies to list nodes.
 *
 * Phase 4F boundary decision (docs/fold-state-conflict-resolution-spec.md
 * §3): this module deliberately has NO relationship with
 * persistence/foldStateManager.ts or persistence/foldStateStore.ts, and
 * none was added. The conflict check above (`current.text !==
 * originalText`) fingerprints only `doc.lines` — the note's actual
 * Markdown content — which fold/unfold actions never touch (fold state
 * lives in a completely separate data.json key, keyed by node identity,
 * never by line content). Symmetrically, applySubtreeEdit's line splice
 * never writes to that store either. The two conflict layers are
 * therefore structurally disjoint, not merely coincidentally non-
 * interacting: a fold toggle can never cause this module to report
 * "conflict", and an Apply here can never silently clobber persisted fold
 * data. The one place they touch at all is indirect and pre-existing
 * (Phase 4E, unchanged by Phase 4F): if an Apply changes a node's own
 * heading/first-line text, that node's fold IDENTITY changes (identity is
 * label-based — see tree/foldIdentity.ts), so any fold state recorded
 * under the OLD identity is simply orphaned and the node reverts to its
 * default expanded display under the new one — see
 * docs/fold-state-spec.md §5. See tests/foldStateConflict.test.ts for a
 * regression test pinning this separation down.

 * Phase 5C-2 (2026-08-14): when `nodeId` does not resolve in `doc.nodes`
 * (this module's Phase 5C note above already documented this as the
 * pre-existing behavior for ANY ComplexBlockInfo id), this now makes ONE
 * additional attempt before giving up: a fresh `scanComplexBlocks(doc)`
 * pass, looking for a callout/blockquote whose own id matches AND whose
 * `editability === "supported"` — the exact same eligibility gate
 * tree/buildOutlineTree.ts's isStandaloneComplexBlockEligible uses for
 * deciding whether to project a Tree row for it in the first place, kept
 * independently re-implemented here (not imported) for the same
 * "each layer re-verifies against current ground truth, never trusts a
 * caller's earlier judgment" reason edit/deleteCompositeBlock.ts's own top
 * doc comment gives for its own re-parse/re-scan/re-match design. A
 * complex block whose id doesn't resolve at all, or resolves but is no
 * longer "supported" (e.g. the note changed between Tree render and
 * Apply), still reports plain "resolve-failed" — this module intentionally
 * does not grow a THIRD failure-reason tier for that distinction; the
 * Partial Edit Pane has no different Notice text for "never existed" vs.
 * "existed but is no longer eligible" and treating both the same is
 * exactly the safe, no-guessing behavior every other boundary check in
 * this codebase already prefers. `scanComplexBlocks` takes only `doc` (no
 * settings/rules involved, unlike CompositeBlock matching), so running it
 * here has no dependency on the Outline Tree's own composite-rule
 * settings and is cheap enough to run per extract/apply call, matching how
 * every other edit/*CompositeBlock.ts module already re-derives its own
 * scan fresh rather than accepting one from the caller.
