/**
 * Phase 5C-3 (2026-08-14): a pure function that safely swaps a standalone
 * (non-composite-member) callout/blockquote with the adjacent standalone
 * callout/blockquote in a given up/down direction, given the CURRENT
 * Markdown text and a snapshot of what the caller believes it selected.
 *
 * Deliberately, strictly mirrors edit/moveCompositeBlock.ts's own
 * "re-parse -> re-scan -> re-match -> snapshot照合 -> judge再評価 ->
 * resolver再解決 -> swapBlocks" design (Phase 5C-3 approval's own fixed
 * step order): this module has NO Obsidian dependency, calls no Editor API,
 * and is wired into view/OutlineTreeView.ts only via a thin dispatch
 * method, exactly like moveCompositeBlock's own relationship to
 * dispatchAndApplyCompositeMove.
 *
 * ---- Relationship to the judge/resolver layers ----
 *
 *   - parser/compositeBlocks.ts#evaluateStandaloneComplexBlockMovability
 *     (judge): may this standalone block move in this direction.
 *   - move/findStandaloneComplexBlockMoveTarget.ts#findStandaloneComplexBlockMoveTarget
 *     (resolver): given that it may, what is the exact LineRange to swap
 *     with.
 *   - moveStandaloneComplexBlock (this file, executor): given the caller's
 *     snapshot, re-verify identity against the CURRENT text and perform the
 *     swap via move/moveBlock.ts's existing swapBlocks primitive
 *     (UNCHANGED — no new swap logic is written here).
 *
 * ---- Why this function re-parses / re-scans / re-matches internally ----
 *
 * A ComplexBlockInfo's `callout-N`/`blockquote-N` id is "stable only within
 * a single scanComplexBlocks() call" (see model/complexBlock.ts's own
 * ComplexBlockInfo.id doc comment) — exactly the same reason
 * edit/deleteCompositeBlock.ts and edit/moveCompositeBlock.ts never trust a
 * bare id captured at Tree-render time. So this function takes the raw
 * CURRENT `text` and performs its own parseDocument -> scanComplexBlocks ->
 * matchCompositeBlocks pass (matchCompositeBlocks is needed here too,
 * despite this feature never touching a CompositeBlock itself, because
 * evaluateStandaloneComplexBlockMovability's own "not currently a composite
 * member" check requires a fresh composite-match result to check against —
 * see that function's own doc comment), then finds the ComplexBlockInfo
 * that matches the caller-supplied StandaloneComplexBlockSnapshot BY
 * STRUCTURE (kind, range, parentId) — never by `id` alone (see
 * snapshotMatches below, and StandaloneComplexBlockSnapshot.id's own doc
 * comment).
 *
 * ---- What this function does NOT do ----
 *
 * No blank-line cleanup before/after the swapped ranges beyond what
 * swapBlocks already preserves automatically, no Markdown reformatting/
 * renormalization of any kind, no content/text-hash comparison (a move
 * relocates whatever content currently sits at the re-verified structural
 * position — it is not a round-trip edit like the Partial Edit Pane, which
 * IS content-sensitive by design; see edit/partialEdit.ts's own conflict
 * check for that different concern). Every rejection path leaves `lines`
 * byte-identical to the input (`changed: false`).

 * adjacent CANDIDATE side even when `allowComposedMember` is `true`, since
 * that side is never widened.

 * Steps (fixed order per Phase 5C-3 approval):
 *   1. `findRangeInvalidReason` on the snapshot alone — "range-invalid" on
 *      failure.
 *   2. `parseDocument` -> `scanComplexBlocks` -> `matchCompositeBlocks`
 *      (fresh, against `rules` — the CALLER's currently-enabled rule set),
 *      then find the ComplexBlockInfo matching `snapshot` via
 *      `snapshotMatches`. "standalone-boundary-changed" if none matches.
 *   3. `evaluateStandaloneComplexBlockMovability(doc, complexScan, resolved,
 *      direction, composites, allowComposedMember)` (the judge). `eligible:
 *      false` -> that exact `reason`.
 *   4. `findStandaloneComplexBlockMoveTarget(doc, complexScan, resolved,
 *      direction, composites, allowComposedMember)` (the resolver), re-run
 *      against the SAME doc/complexScan/composites step 3 just used. `null`
 *      -> "no-target" (defensive; see NoStandaloneComplexBlockMoveReason's
 *      own doc comment
 *      for why this should be unreachable in practice).
 *   5. `move/moveBlock.ts#swapBlocks(lines, resolved.range, target.range)`
 *      — UNCHANGED, existing primitive. Returns `changed: true` with the
 *      moved block's own new start line.
