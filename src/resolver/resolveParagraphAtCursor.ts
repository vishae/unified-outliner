/**
 * Phase 5P-2: cursor position -> the single paragraph it belongs to, if
 * any. A pure, Obsidian-free resolver, INDEPENDENT of
 * move/resolveMoveTarget.ts's resolveMoveUnit — that module resolves the
 * "minimal safe MOVE unit" at a cursor, which for a line inside a list
 * item (including a list-item-child paragraph, per Phase 5P-1) is
 * deliberately the ENCLOSING LIST SUBTREE, never the paragraph itself —
 * see that module's own "Paragraph-as-move-unit note" and Phase 5P-1R's
 * isSafeToMoveComplexBlock guard (move/resolveMoveTarget.ts), which
 * exists specifically to keep Move block's surface pinned to its pre-5P-1
 * scope. This resolver answers a different question — "is the cursor on
 * a paragraph that can be hoisted into the Partial Edit Pane, and if so,
 * which one, exactly" — and deliberately DOES accept a list-item-child
 * paragraph as a valid resolution target: Partial Edit hoist has no
 * relationship with Move block's list-scope restriction (see
 * docs/phase5p_paragraph-block-foundation-plan.md §7's 5P-2 scope).
 *
 * This resolver is the sole "extract" step for Phase 5P-2's paragraph
 * Partial Edit hoist — see edit/paragraphPartialEdit.ts for the matching
 * "apply" step (a separate module, not this one, because Apply-time
 * re-resolution needs additional identity bookkeeping — see that module's
 * own doc comment for why). It never inserts anything into
 * ParsedDocument.nodes, never assigns a persistent id to a paragraph
 * (Markdown text is the plugin's only source of truth — see
 * docs/phase5p_paragraph-block-foundation-plan.md), and never touches
 * Obsidian's Editor/EditorView/DOM/Notice APIs — the returned
 * `complexBlockId` is a scan-local id (parser/complexBlocks.ts's own
 * per-call sequence, same convention as every other ComplexBlockInfo),
 * never a stored/persisted identifier.
 *
 * Resolution rules (5P-2 ticket §2-2): a paragraph resolves successfully
 * ONLY when the cursor line sits inside a parser/complexBlocks.ts-
 * recognized paragraph whose editability is "supported" (Phase 5P-1R:
 * boundary/parent/depth confidently resolved) — covering both a
 * section-direct paragraph and a list-item-child paragraph (Phase 5P-1),
 * including a top-level paragraph in a headingless note (parentId null).
 * It fails safely — never guesses — on: a blank line; an ATX heading
 * line; a list-marker line; inside a callout / blockquote / fenced-code
 * (closed or unterminated) / table / thematic-break; inside frontmatter; a
 * boundary-ambiguous paragraph candidate (crosses an existing
 * section/list boundary, or lost a merge-priority conflict — see
 * parser/complexBlocks.ts's mergeBlockRangesSafely doc comment); more than
 * one recognized block claiming the same line (defensive — should not
 * occur among genuinely accepted, non-overlapping candidates, but the
 * merge step can leave an ambiguous duplicate covering an already-accepted
 * block's own range, e.g. a table's own rows also independently
 * "recognized" — and downgraded — by the paragraph scanner); and an
 * out-of-range cursor line. A neighboring heading/list/blockquote/callout/
 * fenced-code/table/thematic-break is never folded into the resolved
 * range — the returned range is always exactly one scanner-recognized
 * paragraph candidate's own range, never wider.
