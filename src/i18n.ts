/**
 * i18n実装 (2026-08-11 ticket, "Unified Outliner：日本語／英語 UI 切替の実装指示"):
 * pure, Obsidian-free translation module. Kept Obsidian-free for the same
 * reason settingsDefaults.ts is (see that file's doc comment): so it can be
 * unit-tested directly from Vitest without importing Obsidian as a value.
 *
 * Design summary:
 *  - `PluginLanguage` ("auto" | "ja" | "en") is the persisted setting value.
 *    "auto" means "follow Obsidian's own UI language" — resolved to a
 *    concrete `SupportedLocale` via resolveLocale(), which takes the
 *    Obsidian-dependent detection result (if any) as a plain string hint
 *    from the caller, so this module never has to know HOW that hint was
 *    obtained.
 *  - Every user-facing string the plugin owns is a key in `en` (the
 *    authoritative key set). `ja` is typed as `Record<TranslationKey,
 *    string>`, so TypeScript itself fails the build if a key is added to
 *    one dictionary and forgotten in the other — no separate "key parity"
 *    bookkeeping is needed.
 *  - Key names are meaning-based slugs (`command.moveBlockUp`,
 *    `reason.top-of-document`, ...), never the English text itself, so
 *    English wording can change freely without touching the ja dictionary
 *    or any call site.
 *  - `reason.*` keys intentionally reuse the exact same string literals
 *    that move/indent/rename/delete/insert outcomes already return as
 *    `LineEditOutcome.reason` (see commands/applyLineEditOutcome.ts's
 *    NOOP_MESSAGES, which stays English-only and unchanged, both as the
 *    single source of truth for which reason strings exist and so its own
 *    existing tests keep passing byte-for-byte) — callers translate a
 *    reason via `t(("reason." + reason) as TranslationKey)` rather than
 *    looking it up in NOOP_MESSAGES.
 *  - `createTranslator(locale)` returns a small `(key, vars?) => string`
 *    function with minimal `{name}`-style interpolation, enough for this
 *    plugin's existing dynamic strings (the move-result toast, "N more",
 *    "Editing (Kind): Label").

 * caller supplies — e.g. `localStorage.getItem("language")`, the same
 * mechanism several community plugins use to read Obsidian's own UI
 * language, since Obsidian's typed API has no official accessor for it).
 * Falls back to "en" whenever the hint is missing or not recognizably
 * Japanese, per this ticket's own explicit "auto→en fallback is
 * acceptable" allowance. "ja"/"en" pass straight through, and any other
 * (corrupted/future/unknown) value also falls back to "en" rather than
 * throwing, so a hand-edited or stale data.json can never crash the
 * plugin over this setting.
