/**
 * Phase 3B: Partial Edit Pane (docs/別ペイン実装計画と当面の実装指示.md, forward-looking
 * §7 in spirit — this view is new territory beyond what that doc's earlier
 * phases covered).
 *
 * A focused editing pane for exactly ONE subtree at a time, opened from
 * the Outline Tree View's right-click menu. This is NOT an alternate
 * full-document editor: the original note is always the single source of
 * truth, and this pane only ever holds a temporary, explicitly-applied
 * copy of one subtree's raw Markdown (heading + body + child sections +
 * lists for a section, per section-subtree; item + nested children for a list, per
 * Phase 4A's relocateListSubtree — the exact same range every other
 * block-scoped command already treats as one unit).
 *
 * Deliberately explicit-save, not live-synced: edits made here stay local
 * to the pane's textarea until the user clicks Apply. There is no
 * autosave and no real-time two-way sync with the body editor — see the
 * README's Phase 3B section for the full list of what this phase
 * intentionally does not attempt (multi-node editing, cross-note editing,
 * diff/merge UI, conflict resolution beyond a simple before/after text
 * comparison).
 *
 * Node resolution and the actual text splice are both delegated to
 * ../edit/partialEdit.ts (Obsidian-free, unit-tested) — this view only
 * wires that pure logic to a textarea and to the active note's Editor via
 * ../commands/applyLineEditOutcome.ts, exactly like every other
 * tree-triggered command in this plugin.
 *
 * Phase 4C (list subtrees): originally section-only, this view now loads
 * either kind via the same loadNode()/applyEdit() path — the generalized
 * extractSubtreeText/applySubtreeEdit (edit/partialEdit.ts) don't care
 * which kind of node they're resolving, so nothing here branches on
 * section vs. list except the header label (renderLoadedState below) and
 * the small "(Empty list item)" vs "(Untitled heading)" placeholder text used
 * when a node's own label is empty. Everything else — the textarea, the
 * Apply/Cancel/Close buttons, the conflict check, the unsafeIndent
 * refusal for list nodes — is one shared code path.
 *
 * Real-device follow-up: the header's Apply/Cancel row also has a one-click
 * × (close) button, `this.leaf.detach()` under the hood — before this,
 * closing the pane required Obsidian's own tab-close affordances (the
 * tab's native × or the right-click "Close tab" menu item), a two-step
 * detour compared to every other button on this pane's own header. Closing
 * this way still never applies pending edits, exactly like Cancel and the
 * pre-existing onClose() already didn't.
 *
 * Further real-device follow-up: Apply/Cancel/Close are now each shown
 * conditionally rather than unconditionally whenever a node is loaded —
 * see updateDirtyState (Apply/Cancel only appear once the textarea
 * actually differs from the loaded snapshot) and updateCloseButtonVisibility
 * (this pane's own × only appears where Obsidian doesn't already draw a
 * native tab ×, i.e. while docked directly in the left/right sidebar —
 * see that method's doc comment for the sidebar-vs-tab/popout distinction).
 *
 * Phase 5B (docs/phase5-implementation-plan.md): adds an ancestor
 * breadcrumb below the header row, so the pane (including a popped-out
 * window with no Outline Tree in sight) still shows where the loaded node
 * sits in the document. The node-loading entry point is now split in two:
 * loadNodeInternal (private, unconditional — the old loadNode, renamed)
 * and requestLoadNode (public, the ONLY sanctioned external entry point),
 * which guards loadNodeInternal behind an Apply/Discard/Cancel prompt
 * whenever the pane has an unapplied edit. Every caller that used to reach
 * this pane's loadNode directly — main.ts's activatePartialEditView, and
 * now this file's own breadcrumb segment clicks — goes through
 * requestLoadNode instead, so "switch node" always means the same thing
 * regardless of which UI triggered it. See requestLoadNode's own doc
 * comment for the full rationale.
 *
 * Subtree Navigator (post-Phase-5B follow-up): the downward counterpart to
 * the ancestor breadcrumb above. A third header row (renderSubtreeNavigator)
 * shows the loaded node's own direct children (tree/descendantPath.ts) as
 * clickable chips, so a user can descend into a subtree one level at a
 * time from inside the pane — including a popped-out window with no
 * Outline Tree visible — the same way the breadcrumb lets them climb back
 * up. Every chip (and its overflow Menu, when there are more children than
 * fit inline) calls requestLoadNode, never loadNodeInternal directly, so
 * descending shares the exact same dirty-guard/Apply-Discard-Cancel
 * behavior as breadcrumb and Tree navigation — see requestLoadNode's doc
 * comment, unchanged by this addition.
 *
 * Sibling前後移動 (docs/phase5b_sibling-navigation-spec.md): the sideways
 * counterpart to both of the above. A fourth header row (renderSiblingNav),
 * between the breadcrumb and the Subtree Navigator, holds two buttons —
 * previous/next sibling of the loaded node, resolved by
 * tree/siblingNavigation.ts directly from the node's existing
 * `prevSiblingId`/`nextSiblingId` (no new sibling-order computation). Both
 * buttons call requestLoadNode exactly like every other navigation control
 * on this pane — no new projection path, no new dirty guard. Unlike the
 * breadcrumb and Subtree Navigator (hidden entirely when empty), this row
 * stays visible whenever a node is loaded and disables whichever button has
 * no target, per the spec's §3 UI 仕様.

   * DOM tree itself (no empty()/createSpan for the buttons) — the two
   * buttons, and their target-label spans, are created once in onOpen and
   * always exist; only `disabled` state, tooltip, and the target-label

   * visible and each button disables itself independently when that
   * direction has no sibling — deliberately different from the breadcrumb
   * and Subtree Navigator's "hide the whole row when empty" policy, since a
   * node with siblings on only one side should still make that one
   * direction discoverable.
   *
   * Target-label preview: each button's *TargetEl span shows the
   * destination sibling's own displayLabel (same field the breadcrumb and
   * Subtree Navigator already use — see AncestorPathEntry.label /
   * DescendantNavigationEntry.label), so the pane shows where "Previous" /
   * "Next" actually lead before either is clicked. CSS truncates a long
   * label (styles.css); the button's own tooltip below always carries the
   * full, untruncated label. When a direction has no sibling, its target
   * span is cleared and hidden rather than showing empty space — no target
   * label for a disabled button, matching the button's own disabled state.
