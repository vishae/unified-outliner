/**
 * Phase 5C-3 (2026-08-14): resolves the full swap TARGET for a standalone
 * (non-composite-member) callout/blockquote move, given that
 * parser/compositeBlocks.ts#evaluateStandaloneComplexBlockMovability has
 * already confirmed a move in that direction is eligible.
 *
 * Deliberately mirrors move/findCompositeMoveTarget.ts's own judge/resolver
 * split exactly:
 *   - evaluateStandaloneComplexBlockMovability is the JUDGE: "may this
 *     standalone block move in this direction", with an explainable
 *     rejection reason when not.
 *   - findStandaloneComplexBlockMoveTarget (this file) is the RESOLVER:
 *     "given that it may, what is the exact LineRange to swap it with".
 * This module calls evaluateStandaloneComplexBlockMovability itself, as the
 * very first thing it does, and returns `null` immediately when it says
 * `eligible: false` — it never re-derives an equivalent judgment
 * independently. The actual adjacency scan reuses
 * parser/compositeBlocks.ts's own exported `skipBlankLines` and
 * `findAdjacentStandaloneComplexBlock` rather than a second, independently-
 * written implementation. Re-running the same scan a second time (once
 * inside evaluateStandaloneComplexBlockMovability, once again here) is
 * deliberate, not wasteful — mirrors findCompositeMoveTarget's own doc
 * comment and this whole codebase's "never guess, always re-verify against
 * current ground truth" policy.
 *
 * ---- No composite-widening here ----
 *
 * Unlike findCompositeMoveTarget, this module never widens its resolved
 * target: Phase 5C-3's approved adjacency candidates are limited to OTHER
 * standalone callout/blockquote blocks only ("A案") — never a list item or
 * another CompositeBlock — so the adjacent block's own `range` (a single,
 * atomic complex block, never decomposed) is always exactly what gets
 * swapped, with no further resolution step needed.
 *
 * ---- What this module does NOT do ----
 *
 * No doc.lines mutation, no move/moveBlock.ts#swapBlocks call, no command
 * wiring, no Notice — this module resolves WHICH range to swap with,
 * nothing more. Actually performing the swap (full no-op-on-failure
 * semantics included) is edit/moveStandaloneComplexBlock.ts's job.
