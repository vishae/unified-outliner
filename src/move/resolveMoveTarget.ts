/**
 * Cursor -> "minimal safe block to move" resolution.
 *
 * Ticket (2026-08-11, "Move block up/down の対象を最小安全ブロックへ"): the
 * body-editor "Move block up/down" command used to resolve ANY cursor
 * position inside a section (including a plain body paragraph that is not
 * inside any list) to that section's own BlockNode — because
 * resolver/resolveCurrentBlock.ts's `lineToOwningNodeId` has no notion of
 * "paragraph" at all (see model/block.ts: a SectionBlockNode IS the whole
 * subtree, not just the heading line), every non-list body line resolved to
 * "the enclosing section," and Move block therefore moved the WHOLE section
 * even when the user's intent was "move just this paragraph." This module
 * is the fix: it re-resolves the cursor to the narrowest Markdown-safe unit
 * BEFORE any move decision is made, using the existing block model for
 * section/list and Phase 5C's complex-block scanner
 * (parser/complexBlocks.ts) for everything else.
 *
 * Design boundary (read before extending): this module answers ONLY "what
 * would Move block operate on right now, from this cursor line, and what is
 * its adjacent sibling in that direction" — for section/list units it is a
 * thin, non-duplicating wrapper around the EXISTING, already-tested
 * move/findMoveTarget.ts + move/moveBlock.ts pair (same sibling-tracking
 * fields, same cross-section list hop, same unsafe-indent guard — nothing
 * about that path changes). Only paragraph/complex-block units
 * (callout/blockquote/fenced-code/table/paragraph) get NEW logic here,
 * because those are not BlockNode's and have no prevSiblingId/nextSiblingId
 * to walk (see model/complexBlock.ts's doc comment: ComplexBlockInfo values
 * are never inserted into ParsedDocument.nodes).
 *
 * Paragraph-as-move-unit note: docs/mixed-structure-spec.md §6 and
 * parser/complexBlocks.ts's scanParagraphBlocks doc comment establish that
 * paragraphs are NEVER a drag & drop / Partial Edit Pane / Tree-node target.
 * This ticket does not revisit that policy — a paragraph still never
 * becomes a Tree row, is still not addressable by id outside a single Move
 * block invocation, and still cannot be opened in the Partial Edit Pane.
 * "Move block" is a narrower, new capability: cut-and-reinsert a contiguous
 * paragraph range in place, exactly the same swapBlocks() primitive
 * section/list moves already use — never a per-line splice. See
 * isSafeToMoveComplexBlock's doc comment for the precise safety gate this
 * introduces.
 *
 * Phase 5P-1R correction (2026-08-17): Phase 5P-1 made paragraphs owned by a
 * list item (indented to the item's own content-start column) newly
 * recognizable by parser/complexBlocks.ts's scanParagraphBlocks. Because
 * this module's ORIGINAL safety gate keyed only on editability (any
 * confidently-bounded paragraph was move-safe, regardless of what owns it),
 * that Phase 5P-1 recognition change would have silently WIDENED Move
 * block's existing surface to include list-item-child paragraphs — a
 * capability Phase 5P explicitly reserves for a later, separately-approved
 * sub-phase (5P-4, "隣接交換の正式契約化" — see
 * docs/phase5p_paragraph-block-foundation-plan.md §6). isSafeToMoveComplexBlock
 * below now explicitly excludes any paragraph whose parentId resolves to a
 * list-typed node, restoring Move block's paragraph surface to EXACTLY what
 * it was before Phase 5P-1 (a paragraph owned by a section, or by nothing —
 * never by a list item), independent of Phase 5P-1R's separate
 * "read-only" → "supported" editability change (see
 * parser/complexBlocks.ts's scanParagraphBlocks doc comment) for confidently-
 * bounded paragraphs.
