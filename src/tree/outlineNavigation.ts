/**
 * Pure keyboard-navigation helpers for the Outline Tree View sidebar.
 *
 * This is a DIFFERENT concept from tree/resolveHighlightedSectionId.ts:
 * that module resolves which node the BODY EDITOR's cursor currently sits
 * inside (the "current" row, styled via .unified-outliner-current). This
 * module instead supports moving a KEYBOARD SELECTION around the sidebar
 * itself — Up/Down/Left/Right/Enter operating on the tree as displayed,
 * independent of where the body editor's cursor happens to be. The two
 * states can disagree (e.g. the user arrows around the sidebar without
 * pressing Enter) and OutlineTreeView.ts renders them with distinct CSS
 * classes (.unified-outliner-current vs .unified-outliner-selected) for
 * exactly that reason.
 *
 * Every function here is a plain function over OutlineTreeNode[] / Set /
 * Map — no Obsidian dependency, no DOM — matching every other pure module
 * under src/tree, src/move, src/level, src/resolver.

/**

 * selection into the body editor (OutlineTreeView.ts's
 * followSelectionIntoBody, which calls jumpToLine with
 * `focusEditor: false` — the same call a row click makes, but without
 * stealing DOM focus away from the tree panel).
 *
 * Two independent conditions both have to hold:
 *
 *  1. `followEnabled` — the user's own setting
 *     (UnifiedOutlinerSettings.followKeyboardSelectionIntoBody). Default
 *     true (this is the shipped, already-verified behavior); turning it
 *     off restores the pre-existing Phase 4D behavior where arrow keys
 *     only move the tree's own selection and only Enter jumps into the
 *     body.
 *  2. The selection actually moved to a DIFFERENT node (`nextId !== null
 *     && nextId !== previousId`). This is what already, implicitly, kept
 *     OutlineTreeView.ts's in-place fold/unfold branches (which update
 *     collapsedIds via setNodeCollapsed but leave selectedId untouched)
 *     from re-triggering a body jump on every fold toggle — centralizing
 *     that condition here makes it a single, testable rule instead of
 *     "whichever branches happen to call followSelectionIntoBody".
 *
 * Kept here (not in OutlineTreeView.ts) so the whole decision — including
 * the "did selection actually change" state-transition check — is a plain
 * function over primitives, testable without any Obsidian/DOM dependency
 * (see tests/outlineNavigation.test.ts). What can't be unit-tested this
 * way is the DOM-focus side of the story (that jumpToLine's
 * `focusEditor: false` path re-focuses treeRootEl rather than the editor)
 * — that remains a manual/実機 verification concern, same as every other
 * focus-related fix in this view's history.
