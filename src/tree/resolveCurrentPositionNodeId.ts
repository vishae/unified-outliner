/**
 * Phase 5T-5A (implements Phase 5T-5D's 案A): resolves which Tree node the
 * BODY EDITOR's cursor line CURRENTLY corresponds to, extended beyond the
 * pre-existing section/list-only resolveHighlightedSectionId.ts to also
 * cover the 3 ComplexBlockKind values that actually have their own Tree
 * row today — paragraph, callout, blockquote (see
 * docs/phase5t5_cursor_to_tree_highlight_design.md §3-3: fenced-code/
 * table/thematic-break never have a Tree row of their own, standalone or
 * as a composite member, so they are not — and cannot be — resolved to
 * anything more specific than the existing section/list fallback below).
 *
 * This is a genuinely NEW file rather than an extension of
 * resolveHighlightedSectionId.ts itself (design doc §4, 案A vs 案B): that
 * module stays untouched and BlockNode-only, and this module composes on
 * top of it rather than absorbing its logic, mirroring the same
 * "paragraph gets its own dedicated branch, never merged into an existing
 * one" precedent Phase 5P-3 established for tree/buildOutlineTree.ts.
 *
 * Deliberately used for TWO purposes by view/OutlineTreeView.ts (Phase
 * 5T-5A): computing `highlightedId` from the live cursor line, AND
 * re-resolving `selectedId` from a move/edit outcome's own `newStartLine`
 * after a refresh (selection-follow — see that file's
 * resolveSelectionAfterRefresh). Both are fundamentally the same
 * question — "which currently-displayed Tree row does this one document
 * line best represent" — so sharing this one pure resolver for both
 * avoids two independently-drifting copies of the same priority logic.
 * `highlightedId` and `selectedId` remain otherwise fully independent
 * pieces of view state; only this stateless line->id computation is
 * shared.
 *
 * Correctness for "does this candidate actually have a Tree row right
 * now" is delegated entirely to `nodeById` (built by
 * tree/outlineNavigation.ts#buildNodeByIdMap from the CURRENT
 * buildOutlineTree() output) rather than re-deriving standalone/composite-
 * member eligibility here: a ComplexBlockInfo's own candidate id is only
 * ever accepted when `nodeById.has(candidateId)` is true, which is exactly
 * equivalent to "this content is displayed as some Tree row right now,
 * whether standalone or as a composite member" — see this module's own
 * resolveComplexBlockCandidate for why this sidesteps ever needing to
 * duplicate buildOutlineTree.ts's private isStandaloneComplexBlockEligible/
 * consumedComplexBlockIds logic (which stays private and unexported).

 * Priority (design doc §3-3, confirmed by this module's own tests):
 *  1. A paragraph/callout/blockquote ComplexBlockInfo whose range contains
 *     `cursorLine` AND whose corresponding Tree id is present in
 *     `nodeById` — this includes a paragraph/callout/blockquote NESTED
 *     under a list item (its own dedicated Tree row, when
 *     showParagraphsInOutline/standalone projection put one there), which
 *     is deliberately MORE specific than falling back to that list item's
 *     own row. When more than one candidate's range contains the cursor
 *     (should not happen given this codebase's non-overlapping per-line
 *     ownership — design doc §3-3 point 6 — but handled defensively), the
 *     NARROWEST range wins.
 *  2. Otherwise, the pre-existing resolveHighlightedNodeId(doc, cursorLine,
 *     {includeLists}) result — unchanged section/list behavior, including
 *     its existing null cases (fenced-code interior, frontmatter,
 *     out-of-range).
 *
 * Never mutates fold state and never consults collapsedIds — visibility
 * (nearest-visible-ancestor fallback for highlight, or "hidden -> clear"
 * for selection-follow) is entirely the CALLER's concern (see
 * tree/outlineNavigation.ts#resolveNearestVisibleAncestorId /
 * isOutlineNodeVisible), keeping this resolver a pure function of
 * (doc, cursorLine, complexScan, nodeById) only, per the design doc's
 * §5-1 contract.
