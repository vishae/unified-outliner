/**
 * Phase 4E: stable, content-based node identity for fold-state
 * persistence. A DIFFERENT concept from a node's `id` field
 * (`sec-N`/`li-N`): that id is a fresh per-parseDocument() counter, only
 * meaningful within one parse (see parser/parseDocument.ts) — it cannot be
 * used as a key in data saved to disk, since the very next re-parse (or
 * the very next Obsidian session) will hand out different ids for the
 * exact same content, and two entirely different notes can coincidentally
 * produce the identical id (e.g. both notes' first heading is `sec-0`).
 *
 * Design (see the Phase 4E design report for the full comparison of
 * alternatives — line number, structural sibling-index path, content
 * hash): identity here is a PATH OF LABELS, where each segment is
 * `${kind}:${label}` (label = heading text for a section, item text for a
 * list node). This is deliberately NOT position-based (line number /
 * sibling index), because this plugin's entire purpose is repositioning
 * nodes (move/indent/drag) — a position-based identity would invalidate
 * itself on every single operation the plugin exists to perform.
 *
 * SECTIONS use the full ancestor path of enclosing sections (unchanged
 * across a plain reorder among sibling sections — move-up/down, drag
 * before/after — since none of those change which sections are its
 * ancestors). Indent/outdent that changes a HEADING's level can change
 * which section is its logical parent (that's what re-leveling a heading
 * means) — when that happens, the section's identity legitimately changes
 * and its fold state resets to the default (expanded). This is accepted
 * as a known, narrow limitation (heading indent/outdent is the safety-
 * gated, comparatively infrequent operation — see move/findIndentTarget.ts
 * — not the routine, high-frequency one).
 *
 * LIST NODES instead use the path of their NEAREST ENCLOSING SECTION
 * (not the chain of intermediate list-item ancestors) plus their own
 * label, and are disambiguated against every OTHER list node anywhere
 * under that same enclosing section (regardless of nesting depth), not
 * just their immediate siblings. This is the one deliberate departure
 * from "full ancestor path", and it's intentional: unlike heading
 * indent/outdent, re-nesting a list item under a different sibling item
 * (Tab/Shift-Tab-style indent/outdent) is the single most routine
 * structural edit this plugin exists to support, and a full ancestor-path
 * identity would invalidate a list item's fold state on nearly every
 * indent/outdent — including ones that don't cross a section boundary,
 * which is the overwhelming majority of them. Scoping identity to "which
 * section" rather than "which exact list-item parent" makes indent/
 * outdent WITHIN a section transparent to fold state, at the cost of a
 * list item's identity still changing if it's relocated to a DIFFERENT
 * section entirely (drag & drop "inside" a different section, or a
 * cross-section list move) — accepted as a known, narrower-than-ideal but
 * defensible limitation; a cross-section relocation is a much more
 * structurally significant edit than an ordinary re-nest, so losing fold
 * state there is far less surprising to a user than losing it on every
 * routine indent/outdent would be.
 *
 * In both cases, sibling label collisions (two nodes with the exact same
 * computed `kind:label` within the same disambiguation scope — e.g. two
 * list items that both literally say "TODO") are disambiguated by their
 * occurrence order within that scope, appended as a `#N` suffix. A
 * collapsed identity can therefore point at the "wrong" one of several
 * identically-labeled nodes in the same scope if one with the same label
 * is inserted/removed/reordered before them — a narrow, accepted edge
 * case, not a crash or data-loss risk (worst case: a still-valid sibling
 * in the same scope shows the fold state instead of the exact original
 * node).

/**
 * Phase 5D-0.3: CompositeBlock / complex-member identity policy (see
 * buildNodeIdentityMap's own doc comment for the full walk). Composite
 * nodes and their non-list members ("complex-member" — callout/blockquote)
 * are new OutlineTreeNode kinds (tree/buildOutlineTree.ts) on top of the
 * section/list design above; each gets its OWN identity segment
 * (`composite:...` / `complex-member:...`) and its own per-section
 * occurrence pool, scoped exactly like list nodes (nearest enclosing
 * section, not full ancestor path) — but a composite member that IS a list
 * item (the common "image + OCR" case) is deliberately identified as if it
 * were an ordinary top-level list item, NOT nested under its composite's
 * own path segment. This means a list item's fold identity is completely
 * unaffected by whether it currently happens to be grouped into a
 * composite — if the user edits the note so the composite's match
 * conditions no longer hold (e.g. inserts a blank line before the
 * callout), the CompositeBlock's own identity simply stops being produced
 * (its fold state, if any, is orphaned exactly like any other node whose
 * identity changes — see this file's section/list doc comment above), while
 * the underlying list item keeps its EXACT prior identity and fold state,
 * because that identity was never derived from the composite in the first
 * place.
