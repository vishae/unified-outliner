/**
 * Phase 5D-0: CompositeBlock — a THIRD, separate aggregation layer on top of
 * the existing two block models. Read this file's doc comment before
 * touching model/complexBlock.ts or parser/compositeBlocks.ts; the naming
 * distinction below is deliberate and must not be blurred.
 *
 * ---- Why a third model, and why NOT named "ComplexBlock*" ----
 *
 * model/block.ts's `BlockNode` (section/list) and model/complexBlock.ts's
 * `ComplexBlockInfo` (callout/blockquote/fenced-code/table/paragraph/
 * thematic-break) both describe exactly ONE underlying Markdown construct
 * each. `CompositeBlockInfo` here describes something categorically
 * different: a USER-CONFIGURABLE grouping of two or more ALREADY-RECOGNIZED
 * blocks (from either of the two models above) into one operable/display
 * unit, purely for the Outline Tree projection layer (Phase 5D-0.3 — see
 * docs/phase5d0_3_composite-block-outline-tree-projection-design-memo.md)
 * — e.g. a one-line list item immediately followed by a callout, a common
 * "image + OCR transcript" authoring pattern.
 *
 * `docs/phase5c_block-model-and-tree-display-spec.md` §6 already reserved
 * the term "complex block" / `ComplexBlockKind` for the FIRST model above,
 * and separately reserved "future unified block model" for a hypothetical
 * `BlockNode | ComplexBlockInfo` union. `CompositeBlock` is neither of
 * those — it is read-only, never registered into `ParsedDocument.nodes` or
 * `ComplexBlockScanResult.blocks`, and never changes any existing block's
 * own range, kind, or parent/child relationship. It only OBSERVES the
 * output of parser/parseDocument.ts and parser/complexBlocks.ts and groups
 * some of it. See parser/compositeBlocks.ts's doc comment for the matching
 * algorithm and required conditions.
 *
 * Non-goals (Phase 5D-0.3 design memo §4): CompositeBlock move / drag & drop
 * / indent-outdent / Partial Edit Pane integration, multi-select, a
 * free-form rule-authoring UI (only enabling/disabling the built-in default
 * rules below), nested CompositeBlocks.

/**
 * A member kind a CompositeBlockRule's kindSequence may reference.
 *
 * "single-line-list" (Phase 5D-0.3) is a list item with NO continuation
 * lines and NO nested child list — see parser/compositeBlocks.ts for why
 * `range.startLine === range.endLine` on the underlying ListBlockNode is
 * sufficient to prove both at once. It replaces the earlier
 * `requireSingleLineList` boolean flag: the constraint is now encoded
 * directly in the member kind itself, matching how the rest of this
 * plugin's block models express constraints as distinct kinds rather than
 * kind+flag pairs.
 *
 * "list" (plain, WITHOUT the single-line restriction) and "section" are
 * model/block.ts's BlockNode kinds; the rest are model/complexBlock.ts's
 * ComplexBlockKind. Only kinds with a well-defined, confidently-bounded
 * range should ever appear here — "section" is included for
 * forward-compatibility with a future rule but parser/compositeBlocks.ts's
 * matcher does not currently emit "section" candidates, so no rule that
 * includes it can match yet.

 * DELIBERATELY NOT model/complexBlock.ts's `BlockEditability` — that type
 * answers a narrower question ("can THIS SINGLE callout/blockquote/
 * fenced-code/table's own boundary be trusted"), which is necessary but not
 * sufficient here. A CompositeBlockInfo can be simultaneously:
 *
 *   - RECOGNIZED (produced by parser/compositeBlocks.ts's
 *     matchCompositeBlocks — every member already independently
 *     "supported"/resolvable, see that function's own doc comment), AND
 *   - RENDERABLE (passes tree/buildOutlineTree.ts's
 *     isCompositeSafelyProjectable, i.e. safely shown as a read-only Tree
 *     row today), AND YET
 *   - NOT DELETABLE — e.g. because one of its members sits nested inside
 *     another list item (this phase's deletable set is deliberately
 *     restricted to single-section/top-level-relative composites only; see
 *     parser/compositeBlocks.ts's evaluateCompositeBlockDeletability doc
 *     comment for the full condition list).
 *
 * These three questions (recognized / renderable / deletable) are
 * intentionally kept as three separate, non-overlapping concerns — this
 * ticket must not blur "can be shown" with "can be safely removed as one
 * unit". `CompositeBlockDeletability` is produced FRESH, on demand, by
 * evaluateCompositeBlockDeletability; it is NEVER stored as a field on
 * CompositeBlockInfo itself (CompositeBlockInfo, like ComplexBlockInfo,
 * stays a read-only recognition value with no baked-in judgment about what
 * a future editing phase may do with it).
 *
 * Phase 5C-1 ticket 1 performs NO deletion of any kind and is not wired
 * into the Outline Tree, any context menu, or any editor mutation — this
 * type and its evaluator exist solely so a future edit/deleteCompositeBlock.ts
 * (a later, separate ticket) has one already-vetted safety gate to consult
 * before ever touching doc.lines. See parser/compositeBlocks.ts for the
 * evaluator and describeCompositeBlockRejection (the id-based lookup
