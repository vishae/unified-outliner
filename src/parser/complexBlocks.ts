/**
 * Phase 5C: Obsidian-free, pure-function recognition of "complex" Markdown
 * blocks — callout, blockquote, fenced-code (including Mermaid), table, and
 * paragraph — on top of an already-parsed ParsedDocument (see
 * parser/parseDocument.ts).
 *
 * SCOPE (unchanged from the initial Phase 5C revision, reconfirmed by the
 * follow-up ticket that added blockquote): this module ONLY recognizes and
 * classifies. It does not move, edit, render, or fold anything, and nothing
 * it exports is imported by view/OutlineTreeView.ts, view/PartialEditView.ts,
 * any move/* module, tree/ancestorPath.ts, tree/descendantPath.ts, or
 * main.ts's projection entry point. Tree display, icons, displayLabel
 * wiring, move/indent/outdent/drag & drop, hoist, and Partial Edit Pane
 * integration are Phase 5D+ concerns — see
 * docs/phase5c_block-model-and-tree-display-spec.md. See
 * model/complexBlock.ts's doc comment for why ComplexBlockKind is a
 * separate, scanner-only type rather than a rename/extension of BlockNode.
 *
 * ---- Ground truth reuse (never re-detected independently) ----
 *
 * Frontmatter and fenced-code line membership are NEVER re-derived here:
 * every scanner below treats `doc.frontmatterLines` and `doc.codeBlockLines`
 * (both already computed by parser/parseDocument.ts) as ground truth and
 * skips those lines outright. This is the mechanism that satisfies "fenced
 * code の内部を callout / blockquote / table / section / list と誤認識し
 * ない" — a line parseDocument.ts already decided is inside a fence can
 * never become a callout/blockquote/table/paragraph candidate here, by
 * construction. scanFencedCodeBlocks itself does not run a second,
 * independent fence-boundary algorithm — see that function's own doc
 * comment.
 *
 * HEADING_RE and LIST_RE below are intentionally BYTE-IDENTICAL copies of
 * parser/parseDocument.ts's own (private, unexported) regexes of the same
 * name. They are duplicated — not imported — because touching
 * parseDocument.ts is out of scope for Phase 5C (its existing boundary
 * logic must not be replaced or altered). Any future change to either
 * pattern in parseDocument.ts MUST be mirrored here.
 *
 * ---- Callout vs blockquote: classified together, never double-registered ----
 *
 * scanCalloutBlocks and scanBlockquoteBlocks both delegate to the internal
 * scanQuoteRuns helper, which walks every contiguous quote-prefixed
 * (`>`-prefixed) run EXACTLY ONCE and classifies it as callout (first line
 * matches Obsidian's `> [!type]` / `> [!type]+` / `> [!type]-` /
 * `> [!type] title` syntax) or blockquote (first line does not). Because
 * classification happens once, on the SAME scan, before either public
 * function sees the run, a given line range can never be reported under
 * both kinds — there is no merge-time "priority" needed between callout and
 * blockquote specifically, because they are disjoint by construction, not
 * by convention. (mergeBlockRangesSafely's priority order still lists
 * callout before blockquote, both ahead of fenced-code/table, ahead of
 * paragraph — see that function's own doc comment — but callout vs.
 * blockquote conflicts structurally cannot occur, so that ordering only
 * ever matters for conflicts against table/paragraph.)
 *
 * A quote run (of either kind) whose continuation lines contain a
 * callout-start pattern that the run's OWN first line didn't already
 * account for — a nested `> > [!tip]` inside a callout, or a `> [!note]`
 * appearing mid-stream inside what started as a plain blockquote — is
 * reported as editability "unsupported" (boundary known, internal content
 * not modeled) with an "unsupported-callout-nesting" diagnostic. Phase 5C
 * does not attempt to guess whether such embedded syntax means "nested
 * callout", "sibling callout", or "literal quoted text starting with
 * `[!...]`" — all three are plausible readings and guessing wrong would be
 * worse than refusing.
 *
 * ---- Priority / conflict policy (mergeBlockRangesSafely) ----
 *
 * Individual scanners (scanCalloutBlocks, scanBlockquoteBlocks,
 * scanTableBlocks, scanParagraphBlocks) run independently and do NOT know
 * about each other's output, EXCEPT for the callout/blockquote disjointness
 * guaranteed above. A line can still legitimately be claimed by more than
 * one scanner across kinds — e.g. scanParagraphBlocks has no special-case
 * exclusion for pipe-table-row-shaped or quote-prefixed lines, so it
 * legitimately produces paragraph candidates over the same lines a
 * successfully-recognized table or callout/blockquote occupies (see that
 * function's own doc comment; this is intentional, not a bug — paragraph is
 * the lowest-priority catch-all). scanComplexBlocks resolves this
 * explicitly and visibly via mergeBlockRangesSafely, using the fixed
 * priority order:
 *
 *   callout > blockquote > (fenced-code, table, thematic-break) > paragraph
 *
 *   1. callout is highest priority (a callout's own boundary rule is the
 *      most syntactically specific of the five kinds).
 *   2. blockquote is next (disjoint from callout by construction, as above,
 *      but still ranked above the remaining kinds since a plain blockquote
 *      is a stronger, more specific signal than a table/paragraph guess
 *      over the same lines).
 *   3. fenced-code and table are the same tier — in practice they can never
 *      overlap each other (fenced-code is derived from doc.codeBlockLines,
 *      which every other scanner already excludes), so their relative
 *      order doesn't matter; fenced-code is listed first only to match this
 *      module's original (pre-blockquote) ordering.
 *   4. paragraph is lowest priority, per its own doc comment.
 *
 * A lower-priority block that overlaps an already-accepted higher-priority
 * block is NEVER silently dropped and NEVER silently kept as "supported":
 * it is kept in the output with editability downgraded to "ambiguous" and
 * an "overlapping-range" diagnostic is emitted. This mirrors the same
 * "record what happened, refuse the operation, never guess" policy already
 * used throughout move/* and edit/partialEdit.ts. Because callout and
 * blockquote never conflict with EACH OTHER, and because table/fenced-code
 * cannot conflict with each other either, the only downgrades that actually
 * occur in practice are: (paragraph vs. callout/blockquote/table), and any
 * genuinely malformed/ambiguous individual block that already carried its
 * own downgrade before reaching merge. Table, callout, and blockquote are
 * therefore never unnecessarily marked ambiguous by merge for the cases
 * this ticket's tests exercise — see tests/complexBlocks.test.ts.
 *
 * ---- Boundary-crossing parentId policy ----
 *
 * resolveParentId (below) NEVER assigns parentId from a block's startLine
 * alone. It requires every line in the block's range to resolve (via
 * ParsedDocument.lineToOwningNodeId) to the SAME owner, and that owner's
 * own range to fully contain the block's range. A block whose lines
 * disagree on owner gets parentId = null AND editability downgraded to
 * "ambiguous" with an "ambiguous" diagnostic, rather than guessing which
 * owner "wins". This applies identically to callout, blockquote,
 * fenced-code, table, and paragraph — including a blockquote nested inside
 * a list item's continuation, which correctly resolves parentId to that
 * list item (the owner need not be a section).

/**
 * Phase 5D-0: thematic-break recognition (`---`, `***`, `___`, optionally
 * space-separated, up to 3 leading spaces — see THEMATIC_BREAK_RE). Always
 * a single-line range.
 *
 * Candidate lines exclude frontmatter, fenced-code, heading lines
 * (HEADING_RE), and list-marker lines (LIST_RE) — the last exclusion
 * matters because a `-`-only run WITH internal spaces (e.g. "- - -") is
 * itself a valid LIST_RE match (marker "-", content "- -"), and
 * parser/parseDocument.ts already claims that line as a list item; this
 * scanner must never re-claim a line the base parser already turned into
 * "list" structure (list stays BlockNode's exclusive domain, same
 * principle as every other scanner in this module).
 *
 * Setext heading disambiguation (see
 * docs/phase5d0_basic-block-extension-and-composite-block-spec.md §2.2):
 * parser/parseDocument.ts does not parse Setext headings at all (ATX only),
 * and extending it to do so is out of this ticket's scope. A `-`-only run
 * (captured in THEMATIC_BREAK_RE's first alternative) is the ONLY case that
 * can also read as a Setext heading underline (`=`-only runs are not valid
 * thematic-break syntax at all, so they never reach this function; `*`/`_`
 * runs are never valid Setext underlines). When a `-`-only candidate is
 * IMMEDIATELY preceded (no blank line between) by a line that itself looks
 * like ordinary paragraph text — non-blank, not frontmatter/fenced-code,
 * and not itself a heading/list/thematic-break line — this function
 * deliberately does NOT report a thematic-break block for it, leaving the
 * line to fall through to scanParagraphBlocks (or an enclosing list item's
 * continuation) exactly as it already does today. This never produces a
 * WRONG positive claim; it only means some genuine thematic breaks that sit
 * directly under a paragraph (no blank line) are conservatively left
 * unrecognized, matching this whole module's "refuse rather than guess"
 * policy.

/**
 * Paragraph recognition — a range/parent/depth supplier for Phase 5P's
 * "basic block" foundation (see docs/phase5p_paragraph-block-foundation-plan.md),
 * inherited unchanged from Phase 5C's original scanner. Paragraph blocks
 * still NEVER get editability "supported" in this phase (5P-1 adds no
 * operation of any kind — see this file's own restraint below) — only
 * "read-only" (boundary confidently known; no operation is authorized for
 * this instance YET, not "permanently forbidden" — the meaning of
 * "read-only" itself was narrowed by Phase 5P-0, see
 * docs/phase5c_block-model-and-tree-display-spec.md §4 and
 * docs/mixed-structure-spec.md §6) or "ambiguous" (boundary genuinely
 * uncertain). Nothing about this function's output is wired into any Tree
 * display, drag & drop, addition/deletion, or Partial Edit path — Phase 5P-1
 * is recognition only; see the plan doc's §7 "意図的な非対象" list for what
 * remains out of scope.
 *
 * A candidate line must be: non-blank; not frontmatter; not fenced-code; not
 * a heading line; not a list-marker line. Its treatment then depends on
 * `doc.lineToOwningNodeId`:
 *   - Owned by a SECTION (ordinary body text), or owned by nothing
 *     (top-level text before any heading) — always a candidate, exactly as
 *     Phase 5C originally recognized it.
 *   - Owned by a LIST item — Phase 5P-1 narrows the original Phase 5C
 *     blanket exclusion. A line indented AT LEAST as far as the owning list
 *     item's own content-start column (listItemContentColumn, a byte-
 *     identical duplicate of edit/insertBlock.ts's contentColumnOf) is now a
 *     candidate, and resolves (via the existing resolveParentId call below,
 *     unchanged) to that list item's own id as parentId — this is the
 *     "list item の子になる paragraph" case docs/phase5p_paragraph-block-
 *     foundation-plan.md §5 requires. A line indented LESS than that column
 *     remains excluded, exactly as Phase 5C originally treated ALL
 *     list-owned lines: it is still genuinely the list item's OWN single
 *     continuation text (docs/mixed-structure-spec.md, edit/listBodyRange.ts),
 *     not an independently addressable unit. A paragraph that is NOT
 *     indented far enough to be owned by any list item at all (i.e. it sits
 *     at or below the item's own marker column, so parser/parseDocument.ts
 *     itself already closed the item before this line) was never affected
 *     by any of this — it resolves as an ordinary section/top-level
 *     candidate, same as before Phase 5P.
 *
 * This function does NOT exclude quote-prefixed or pipe-table-row-shaped
 * lines — see this module's top doc comment for why that redundancy is
 * intentional and resolved by mergeBlockRangesSafely, not by this scanner.
