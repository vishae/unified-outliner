/**
 * Phase 5D-0: Obsidian-free, pure-function matching of CompositeBlockRule
 * against an already-parsed ParsedDocument (parser/parseDocument.ts) and an
 * already-computed ComplexBlockScanResult (parser/complexBlocks.ts).
 *
 * Like parser/complexBlocks.ts, this module ONLY recognizes and groups. It
 * does not move, edit, render, or fold anything, and it introduces no new
 * IDs into ParsedDocument.nodes or ComplexBlockScanResult.blocks — a
 * CompositeBlockInfo is a read-only VIEW over ids that already exist in one
 * of those two structures. See model/compositeBlock.ts's doc comment for
 * why this is a third, separate model rather than an extension of either
 * existing one.
 *
 * ---- Candidate collection ----
 *
 * Two independent candidate pools, both restricted to blocks whose
 * boundary is confidently known:
 *   - every ListBlockNode in doc.nodes (any depth) — kind
 *     "single-line-list" when it has no continuation lines and no nested
 *     child list (range.startLine === range.endLine proves both at once),
 *     otherwise plain "list". A rule's kindSequence encodes the
 *     single-line requirement directly via which of the two kinds it asks
 *     for (Phase 5D-0.3; replaces the earlier requireSingleLineList flag).
 *   - every ComplexBlockInfo in complexScan.blocks with
 *     editability === "supported" AND kind !== "paragraph" —
 *     "ambiguous"/"unsupported" blocks are excluded by the editability
 *     check, matching this whole plugin's "never build on an uncertain
 *     boundary" policy. Phase 5P-1R (2026-08-17): confidently-bounded
 *     paragraph blocks now also report editability === "supported" (see
 *     parser/complexBlocks.ts's scanParagraphBlocks doc comment) —
 *     "supported" alone no longer implies "eligible for CompositeBlock
 *     membership" for every kind, so paragraph is excluded here by an
 *     EXPLICIT kind check rather than relying on editability to do that
 *     job. Paragraph/CompositeBlock integration remains out of scope until
 *     a future phase explicitly designs it.
 * The two pools are merged and sorted by range.startLine into one
 * document-order candidate list.
 *
 * ---- Matching algorithm ----
 *
 * A single left-to-right pass over the sorted candidate list. At each
 * unconsumed candidate index i, try every rule in the CALLER-SUPPLIED order
 * (which doubles as priority order — see this function's own doc comment
 * below) and accept the FIRST one whose kindSequence matches starting at i,
 * subject to every one of the required conditions below. On a match, every
 * consumed candidate index is marked used (so it can never join a second
 * CompositeBlock) and the scan resumes just past the match; on no match,
 * the scan simply advances to i + 1.
 *
 * Required conditions (see
 * docs/phase5d0_basic-block-extension-and-composite-block-spec.md §3.4):
 *   1. Every member is already a confirmed candidate (see above) — no
 *      re-parsing happens here.
 *   2. The candidate kinds starting at i equal rule.kindSequence exactly,
 *      in document order.
 *   3. No blank line — in fact no gap at all — between consecutive
 *      members: member[k+1].range.startLine must equal
 *      member[k].range.endLine + 1. A rule never matches across a blank
 *      line, matching the ticket's "空行を挟む block 列は複合化しない".
 *   4. Every member resolves (via resolveMemberSectionId, below) to the
 *      SAME enclosing section id (both being null — no enclosing heading —
 *      also counts as "the same").
 *   5. Member ranges never overlap — guaranteed by construction here since
 *      a matched candidate index is immediately marked consumed and a
 *      strict start-line ordering + zero-gap-adjacency check (condition 3)
 *      already rules out overlap between the members of ONE match; across
 *      different matches, the shared `consumed` set prevents any candidate
 *      index — and therefore its range — from being reused.
 *   6. No candidate participates in more than one CompositeBlock — the
 *      `consumed` set enforces this directly.
 *   7. When multiple rules could match at the same starting candidate, only
 *      the highest-priority one (first in the caller's `rules` array) is
 *      used — enforced by trying rules in array order and stopping at the
 *      first full match.

// ---- Phase 5C-1 ticket 1: CompositeBlock delete-eligibility ---------------

// "may this SPECIFIC, already-recognized CompositeBlock be safely deleted
// as one unit" — a strictly narrower, independently re-checked question.
// See model/compositeBlock.ts's CompositeBlockDeletability doc comment for
// why this is a third concern (alongside "recognized" and "renderable",
// the latter being tree/buildOutlineTree.ts's isCompositeSafelyProjectable)
// that must not be blurred with either of the other two.
//
// This ticket adds NO delete implementation (no edit/deleteCompositeBlock.ts,
// no doc.lines mutation of any kind) and is not called from
// view/OutlineTreeView.ts, any context menu, or any command — it exists so
// a LATER ticket has a single, already-vetted, independently-testable
// safety gate to consult before ever touching the note's text.

 * mergeBlockRangesSafely against the LOSING (lower-priority, downgraded)
 * candidate's range, not the winning "supported" block's — and because
 * scanParagraphBlocks is a catch-all that "does NOT exclude quote-prefixed

 * Evaluates whether `composite` (an already-matched CompositeBlockInfo, as

 * be safely deleted as one unit, per Phase 5C-1 ticket 1's approved
 * condition set. Every condition below is re-derived independently from

 * `composite` was produced by matchCompositeBlocks (a future caller could
 * pass a stale or hand-built CompositeBlockInfo), matching this whole
 * codebase's "never guess, always re-verify against the current ground
 * truth" policy (see e.g. tree/buildOutlineTree.ts's
 * isCompositeSafelyProjectable, edit/partialEdit.ts's re-extract-and-compare
 * conflict check).
 *
 * A composite is deletable only when EVERY member independently satisfies
 * ALL of the following (checked in the order below; the FIRST failing
 * member/condition determines the single reported reason — this function
 * does not attempt to collect every violation at once, matching every
 * other rejection-reporting function in this codebase, e.g.
 * parser/complexBlocks.ts's resolveParentId):
 *
 *   1. The member itself resolves: a "list"/"single-line-list" member must
 *      resolve in `doc.nodes` to an actual ListBlockNode; a
 *      "callout"/"blockquote"/"fenced-code"/"table" member must resolve in
 *      `complexScan.blocks` to an actual ComplexBlockInfo. Otherwise:
 *      "member-resolve-failed".
 *   2. The member's KIND is one Phase 5C-1 ticket 1 supports deleting:
 *      "list"/"single-line-list" (the anchor list item itself, always
 *      deleted along with the rest of the composite) or one of "callout" /
 *      "blockquote" / "fenced-code" (including Mermaid — a fenced-code
 *      block's `infoString` never changes this evaluation) / "table".
 *      "paragraph" (always editability "read-only", never a genuine delete
 *      candidate per docs/mixed-structure-spec.md §6) and any other kind
 *      (e.g. a future "section"/"thematic-break" composite member) are
 *      rejected as "unsupported-member-kind" — deliberately explicit here
 *      rather than merely falling out of the editability check below, so a
 *      future new ComplexBlockKind is rejected by default until this
 *      function is revisited, not silently accepted.
 *   3. For a "list"/"single-line-list" member: `unsafeIndent` must be
 *      false. Not explicitly requested by this ticket's own condition
 *      list, but added as defense-in-depth for consistency with every
 *      other list-mutating module in this codebase (move/relocateListSubtree.ts,
 *      edit/partialEdit.ts's extractSubtreeText, edit/insertBlock.ts's
 *      insertChildListItem all refuse mixed tab/space indentation the same
 *      way) — flagged explicitly in this ticket's completion report as an
 *      addition beyond the literal request, not a silent scope change.
 *      Otherwise: "member-unsafe-indent".
 *   4. For a "callout"/"blockquote"/"fenced-code"/"table" member:
 *      `editability === "supported"` (excludes nested callout, unterminated
 *      fence, malformed table, boundary-ambiguous, and overlapping-range
 *      downgrades in one check — see parser/complexBlocks.ts's own
 *      editability assignment). Otherwise: "member-not-supported".
 *   5. For the same complex-kind members: no diagnostic in
 *      `complexScan.diagnostics` overlaps the member's own range (see
 *      hasOverlappingDiagnostic's doc comment for why this is checked
 *      independently of step 4 rather than assumed to be implied by it).
 *      Otherwise: "member-has-diagnostic".
 *   6. The member's resolved owner (a "list"/"single-line-list" member's
 *      BlockNode.parentId; a complex-kind member's ComplexBlockInfo.parentId)
 *      must NOT itself be a "list"-typed node — i.e. the member must sit
 *      directly under its enclosing SECTION (or under no section at all,
 *      top-of-document), never nested inside another list item's
 *      continuation. This is what "単一 section 内・トップレベル相当" means
 *      operationally, and is what excludes a CompositeBlock whose anchor
 *      list item (or a complex-kind member) is itself a nested list child —
 *      see this ticket's completion report for why this narrower first
 *      deletable set was chosen over also supporting nested-in-list
 *      composites immediately. Otherwise: "nested-in-list".
 *
 * After every member individually passes 1–6, one FINAL composite-level
 * check: every member's resolved owner (section id, or null for
 * top-of-document) must be the SAME across all members — re-deriving
 * matchCompositeBlocks's own "same enclosing section" requirement
 * independently, rather than trusting `composite.sectionId` (which was
 * computed by a different code path, at match time, potentially against a
 * stale `doc`/`complexScan` if the caller didn't pass the matching pair).
 * A disagreement here is reported as "ambiguous-section" and — unlike every
 * per-member reason above — is NOT attributed to any single
 * `offendingMemberId`, since the fault is the disagreement itself, not any
 * one member.

// ---- Phase 5C-1 ticket 4-1 (2026-08-14, revised): CompositeBlock move-
// eligibility ----------------------------------------------------------
//
// DESIGN MEMO (superseding this ticket's original sibling-pointer-based
// draft — see this ticket's completion report for the full history of why
// that draft was abandoned before ever shipping):
//
// The ORIGINAL design tried to answer "does an adjacent sibling exist in
// `direction`" by reading `members[0].prevSiblingId`/`nextSiblingId`
// directly off the anchor ListBlockNode. Empirically verified (via a real
// parseDocument() call) to be WRONG: parser/parseDocument.ts's own
// root-item sibling linking (`lastRootItem`, see its pass-2 loop) is reset
// to null the moment ANY non-blank, non-list, non-heading line is
// encountered at or above the current indent — and a CompositeBlock's own
// SECOND member (its callout/blockquote) is EXACTLY such a line. So
// `members[0].nextSiblingId` is null for essentially every real composite
// regardless of what follows it, and the PREVIOUS composite's own trailing
// callout/blockquote equally severs the NEXT composite's
// `members[0].prevSiblingId`. Two composites sitting back-to-back —
// arguably the single most common composite-adjacency shape — could never
// be found eligible under that design. This is a general, pre-existing
// property of this codebase's list-sibling model (not a composite-specific
// bug): the existing plain-list-item move/findMoveTarget.ts already has a
// dedicated NoMoveReason ("blocked-by-paragraph") for the same underlying
// phenomenon.
//
// The REVISED design below never reads BlockNode sibling pointers for this
// purpose. Instead it scans the raw document, starting just outside
// `composite.range`, for the next/previous BLOCK BOUNDARY in the requested
// direction — mirroring move/findMoveTarget.ts's own up/down scanning
// style (skip blank lines, inspect what's found) but adapted to recognize
// both plain list items and other CompositeBlocks as valid adjacency
// targets. Blank lines encountered while scanning are only ever used to
// decide WHERE the next real content starts — they are never deleted,
// merged, or otherwise touched; a future move (ticket 4-3, reusing
// move/moveBlock.ts's existing swapBlocks primitive) preserves whatever
// blank-line gap sat between the two swapped ranges automatically, purely
// because swapBlocks already slices out `lines[a.endLine+1 .. b.startLine)`
// as one unit and re-emits it unchanged between the swapped blocks — no
// new "separator range" data structure is needed as long as this
// resolution step correctly reports the two exact LineRanges to swap.
//
// `allComposites` (needed for the "up" direction only — see
// findAdjacentAnchorNode's own doc comment) and `complexScan` (accepted for
// signature symmetry with evaluateCompositeBlockDeletability but not
// currently needed by this revised algorithm, since a composite boundary
// is already fully described by `allComposites` without re-deriving it
// from complexScan.blocks) are both parameters of this function.

 * at `line` — the boundary found by skipBlankLines, above — in `direction`.
 * Deliberately does NOT consult `doc.lineToOwningNodeId`: that index
 * answers "which node's CONTENT does this line belong to" (its deepest
 * owning section/list, walking into nested continuations), a different
 * question than "which node's own range genuinely STARTS or ENDS exactly
 * here" — trusting the former could, in principle, resolve a line that
 * merely happens to fall inside some unrelated multi-line list item's
 * continuation (which might itself embed unrelated callout/blockquote
 * content) as if it were a fresh block boundary. This function instead
 * does an explicit, unambiguous range-boundary scan over `doc.nodes`.
 *
 *   - direction "down": returns the ListBlockNode whose OWN
 *     `range.startLine === line`, if any. A CompositeBlock's own first
 *     member (`members[0]`) is ALWAYS such a node by construction — its
 *     `range.startLine` is literally `composite.range.startLine` (see
 *     model/compositeBlock.ts's CompositeBlockInfo doc comment) — so this
 *     single check already finds the start of a plain list item OR the
 *     start of another CompositeBlock, with no separate composite-aware
 *     branch needed for this direction.
 *   - direction "up": first tries the same direct check, using
 *     `range.endLine === line`. This finds a plain list item (or a
 *     multi-line list subtree) ending exactly at `line`. If that fails,
 *     falls back to `allComposites`: a CompositeBlock's OWN aggregate
 *     `range.endLine` is usually its LAST member's endLine (typically a
 *     callout/blockquote — a ComplexBlockInfo, which owns no line in
 *     `doc.nodes` at all and therefore can never itself satisfy the direct
 *     ListBlockNode check above). Without this fallback, "up" could never
 *     find a CompositeBlock sitting immediately before another one — the
 *     exact real-pipeline regression this ticket's redesign exists to fix
 *     (two composites back-to-back; see this ticket's completion report).
 *     When a matching composite is found this way, its own `members[0]`
 *     anchor node is returned (never the complex-block member itself),
 *     keeping this function's return type uniformly a ListBlockNode.
 *
 * Exported (ticket 4-2, 2026-08-14) for the same reason as skipBlankLines,
 * above — a shared, single-source-of-truth adjacency primitive for ticket
 * 4-1 (evaluateCompositeBlockMovability) and ticket 4-2
 * (move/findCompositeMoveTarget.ts), not a general-purpose utility.
 * Resolving WHICH composite (if any) the returned node anchors is
 * deliberately left to each caller — this function's own contract stops at
 * "here is the adjacent list node", exactly as before export.

/**
 * Evaluates whether `composite` may be safely swapped with whatever
 * adjacent block sits immediately in `direction`, per Phase 5C-1 ticket
 * 4-1's (revised) approved condition set — checked in the order below; the
 * first failing condition determines the single reported reason, matching
 * every other rejection-reporting function in this codebase:
 *
 *   1. `composite.members[0]` (the anchor list item — always the first
 *      member for every rule in DEFAULT_COMPOSITE_BLOCK_RULES) must resolve
 *      in `doc.nodes` to an actual ListBlockNode, and that node must NOT be
 *      nested inside another list item (isNestedInList, above). Otherwise:
 *      "nested-in-list". (An unresolvable member[0] — only possible when
 *      `composite` is stale relative to `doc`, since matchCompositeBlocks
 *      itself never emits a member[0] that fails to resolve — is also
 *      reported as "nested-in-list": no adjacent unit can be safely
 *      resolved either way once the anchor itself is unknown, and
 *      CompositeBlockMoveRejectionReason has no dedicated
 *      "member-resolve-failed" value, unlike
 *      CompositeBlockDeleteRejectionReason.)
 *   2. EVERY member that is a "list"/"single-line-list" kind must have
 *      `unsafeIndent === false`. Otherwise: "unsafe-indent". (Only
 *      member[0] is ever list-kind under today's
 *      DEFAULT_COMPOSITE_BLOCK_RULES, but this loops over every member for
 *      forward-compatibility with a future rule that includes more than one
 *      list-kind member — mirrors evaluateCompositeBlockDeletability's own
 *      per-member iteration style.)
 *   3. A real block boundary must be found in `direction`: scan from just
 *      outside `composite.range` (skipBlankLines), then resolve it
 *      (findAdjacentAnchorNode). Reaching the document edge/frontmatter, OR
 *      landing on a line that resolves to neither a ListBlockNode boundary
 *      nor a CompositeBlock's own trailing boundary (a section heading, a
 *      composite-less complex block, a plain paragraph, or a
 *      boundary-uncertain block never even collected as a match candidate —
 *      see parser/compositeBlocks.ts's own collectCandidates) — is reported
 *      as "no-adjacent-compatible-unit". This intentionally does NOT hop
 *      across a section heading the way plain-list-item
 *      move/findMoveTarget.ts's cross-section "insert" mode does — composite
 *      move in this ticket is swap-only, never cross-section.
 *   4. The resolved adjacent anchor node's `parentId`, `depth`, AND
 *      `indentColumns` must all equal the moving composite's own anchor's
 *      corresponding fields. Otherwise: "different-parent-or-depth".
 *      `parentId` equality alone is not trusted as a proxy for "same visual
 *      level": a root list item's `depth` is always 0 regardless of its own
 *      `indentColumns` (see the parser's own pass-2 loop — a root item is
 *      simply whatever remains on the list stack after closing, independent
 *      of its exact column), so two root items sharing one section can
 *      legitimately have DIFFERING `indentColumns` (e.g. one at column 0,
 *      another at column 2 after an intervening callout closed the first
 *      list) even though both pass a `parentId`+`depth` check alone —
 *      `indentColumns` is compared as well specifically to catch this and
 *      avoid leaving the moved composite at a visually inconsistent
 *      indentation relative to its new neighbors. (`depth` is, in a
 *      correctly-parsed real document, always fully determined by
 *      `parentId` — checked anyway as defense-in-depth against a hand-built
 *      or otherwise inconsistent ParsedDocument, exactly like
 *      evaluateCompositeBlockDeletability's own comparable checks.) Once
 *      `parentId` matches, the adjacent anchor is —by construction—
 *      guaranteed not itself nested-in-list either (it shares the exact
 *      same, already-verified-non-list parent as this composite's own
 *      anchor), so no separate "sibling-is-nested-in-list"-style check is
 *      needed here.

// section, composite, composite member, or any other ComplexBlockKind
// (paragraph/fenced-code/table/thematic-break). This is intentionally
// narrower than CompositeBlock move's own adjacency scan
// (findAdjacentAnchorNode, above), which also recognizes plain list items
// and other composites as valid partners — that breadth exists because a
// composite's own anchor IS a ListBlockNode with real list-sibling
// semantics; a standalone complex block has none of that, and Phase 5C-3's
// own approval explicitly rejects widening the candidate set to list/
// section/paragraph/fenced-code/table/Mermaid.

 *      that order. Defense-in-depth: a real caller should never reach this
 *      function with an ineligible `target` (see
 *      tree/buildOutlineTree.ts's own isStandaloneComplexBlockEligible,
 *      which already filters to this exact condition before a Tree row is
 *      ever shown), but this function re-verifies its own input rather
 *      than trusting it, same policy as evaluateCompositeBlockMovability's
 *      own anchor re-check above.
 *   2. `target.id` must NOT currently be some CompositeBlockInfo's own
 *      member (re-checked fresh against `allComposites`) — otherwise
 *      "composite-member". Phase 5D-3B ("Composite Member Move Menu
 *      Parity"): this ONE check is skipped when the caller passes
 *      `allowComposedMember: true` (default `false`) — see this
 *      function's own `allowComposedMember` parameter doc below. Every
 *      other condition in this list (including the CANDIDATE side's own
 *      standalone-only restriction in step 3) is completely unaffected by
 *      this flag.
 *   3. A real adjacent boundary must be found in `direction`: scan from
 *      just outside `target.range` (skipBlankLines, reused unchanged from
 *      ticket 4-1/4-2), then resolve it
 *      (findAdjacentStandaloneComplexBlock, above). Reaching the document
 *      edge/frontmatter, or landing on anything that isn't itself an
 *      eligible standalone callout/blockquote (a list item, a section
 *      heading, a composite, a composite member, an unsupported/ambiguous/
 *      read-only block, or any other ComplexBlockKind) is reported as
 *      "no-adjacent-compatible-unit" — this never hops across a section
 *      heading, exactly like CompositeBlock move's own swap-only-never-
 *      cross-section design.
 *   4. The resolved adjacent block's own `parentId` must equal `target`'s
 *      own `parentId` (both null — top-of-document — also counts as
 *      equal, mirroring matchCompositeBlocks's own resolveMemberSectionId
 *      convention). Otherwise: "different-section".
 *
 * `allowComposedMember` (Phase 5D-3B, default `false`): when `true`, step 2
 * above is skipped, so `target` MAY currently be a matched CompositeBlock's
 * own member. This is the ONLY behavioral difference the parameter makes —
 * every other condition (kind/editability/nested-in-list eligibility on
 * `target`, and the CANDIDATE side's own standalone-only restriction, which
 * `findAdjacentStandaloneComplexBlock` always applies regardless of this
 * flag) is identical either way. Every pre-5D-3B caller either omits this
 * parameter or passes `false` explicitly, so this function's behavior for
 * every existing caller (the standalone Tree menu, and
 * edit/moveStandaloneComplexBlock.ts's own re-verification of a standalone
 * move) is byte-for-byte unchanged. Only the NEW composite-member Tree menu
 * (Phase 5D-3B) passes `true`, and only for the block being moved — it
 * never widens the adjacent-candidate search to include other composite
 * members (see step 3's own doc comment above).
