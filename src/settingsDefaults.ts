 * Obsidian PluginSettingTab subclass) so this data and logic can be unit
 * tested directly: node_modules/obsidian has no runtime implementation
 * outside a real Obsidian process (its package.json's "main" is empty —
 * it ships types only), so any module that imports Obsidian classes as
 * VALUES (not just types), like settings.ts's own PluginSettingTab/Setting
 * import, cannot be imported from a vitest test at all. Every other
 * tests/*.ts file in this repo already follows that constraint by only
 * importing Obsidian-free modules (see foldStateAcceptance.test.ts's doc
 * comment for the same reasoning applied to persistence/foldStateStore.ts,
 * which exists for an identical reason relative to foldStateManager.ts).
 * settings.ts re-exports both of these unchanged, so nothing outside this
 * file and settings.ts needs to know the split exists.
