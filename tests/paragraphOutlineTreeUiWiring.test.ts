/**
 * Phase 5P-3 ("本文 paragraph の任意 Outline Tree 表示"): static-source-text
 * checks for view/OutlineTreeView.ts's paragraph wiring — same constraint
 * as tests/listPrefixUiWiring.test.ts / tests/commandTable.test.ts (an
 * Obsidian ItemView subclass cannot be constructed in vitest, since
 * "obsidian" is a types-only package here), so this file inspects the raw
 * source text of OutlineTreeView.ts rather than calling into it.
 *
 * The label/identity/projection VALUE logic (paragraphTreeLabel,
 * groupParagraphBlocks, OutlineTreeParagraphNode shape,
 * collectReadOnlyOutlineNodeIds) is unit-tested with real assertions in
 * tests/buildOutlineTree.test.ts and tests/foldIdentity.test.ts — this file
 * only confirms the view layer wires that projection in at the right place
 * (refresh()) and — the operation-permission guarantees §6 requires — does
 * NOT introduce any rename/delete/insert/drag/Partial-Edit affordance for a
 * paragraph row.
 *
 * Phase 5T-1 amendment: a paragraph row DOES now get exactly one narrow,
 * safety-gated context-menu affordance — Move up/down, reusing 5P-4's swap
 * contract verbatim (see edit/paragraphTreeMove.ts). This file's job from
 * 5T-1 onward is to confirm that exception stays exactly as narrow as the
 * ticket requires: no rename/delete/insert/indent-outdent/drag/Partial-Edit
 * affordance was added alongside it. The dedicated "Phase 5T-1" describe
 * block below covers the new affordance itself; the checks in this first
 * block continue to cover everything that must still be absent.
